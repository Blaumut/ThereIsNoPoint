# ThereIsNoPoint

There's really no point to the game, but to click the circle that appears on the screen.
It may be my first solo project on Android, so it's probably bad.
Although it's abandoned, if changes are made by the community I'd consider adding them officially.
A playable version can be downloaded on https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gerszkoviez.thereisnopoint

Have fun!
